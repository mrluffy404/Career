Perfect, this is exactly how you grow from “MDE guy” → “Microsoft XDR / Security stack specialist”.

Let’s redesign your **2-month, 4 days/week, 1 hr/day (32 sessions)** plan to cover:

* **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**
* **Defender for Office 365 (MDO)**
* **Defender for Identity (MDI)**
* **Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA)**
* **Microsoft Sentinel**
* **Defender for Cloud**
* **Microsoft Purview & Compliance**

I’ll keep it practical and aligned with what you already do in LTI-Mindtree.
