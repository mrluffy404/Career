Here’s a 3-month plan tuned for you:
✅ 4 days/week
✅ 2–3 hours/day
✅ Target roles: **Threat Hunter / Threat Detection Engineer / Endpoint Security Engineer**

## How to use this plan

* Treat it as **minimum viable plan**: if you get extra time, deepen labs, not theory.
* Keep everything in **one structured knowledge base**:

  * Notes
  * KQL snippets
  * Hunt reports
  * Playbooks
* These become assets for:

  * Your **resume**
  * **Interview answers**
  * “Show me your work” in future roles.

If you want, next step I can:

* Turn this into a **simple Excel tracker** (Weeks × Days × Topic × Status), or
* Help you design the **3 hunt reports** in a proper Word/PDF format.
