What is SOC?
-- Security Operation Center
-- Central Hub of Organization's cybersecurity operations
-- Responsible for monitoring, detecting, responding to and mitigating cyber threats in real-time.
-- Provided continous monitoring and protection against cyberattack, data breaches and compliance risks.
-- Eg- Human nervous system/ brain which recives million ofsignal from body. Similarly, SOC recives millions of alerts/logs from different sources-
a. Firewall, Router, VPN logs
b. EDR
c. User Behavior Analytics (UEBA).
d. Cloud services, Databases
Out of all the above only few dozen of alerts/incidents are actionable which we get after correlating, filtering and enrichment.


Tier-1 Specalist-
-- Collecting raw data
-- Reviewing alarms incident
-- Determine the severity or criticality of alert.
-- Confirm is the alert is True positive or False Positive.
-- Monitoring, managing and configuring tools
-- Escalate to Tier-2
-- Eg- Data Exfilteration

Tier-2 Specialist-
-- Higher severity incident.
-- Actively montioring
-- Use of IOC and Rules.
-- Scope of attack and aware of affected/compromised systems.
-- eg- True postive Phishing alert which is has malicious link clicked by the user.

Tier-3 Specialist/ Threat Hunter-
-- Actively monitoring
-- Research for new malware present in the world and create IOC and rules for same.
-- Review Tier-1 and Tier 2 provided data.


>> All Tiers comes under Incident Response Coordinator.


SOC Manager-
-- Hiring and provide training.
-- Managing team.


Additional roles-
1. Reverse Engineers-
-- Check malware and how it works. How it came into the system (decomplie malware).
-- They decompile malware samples in sandboxed or virtual environments.
-- Goal is to identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), command-and-control (C2) mechanisms, persistence techniques, and exploit payloads.
-- Create custom detection signatures, strengthens EDR tools, and guides patching or remediation efforts


2. Threat Hunters- 
-- Proactively search for advanced threat by looking at the logs.
-- Use Frameworks, Threat intelligence, Behavioral Analysis.
-- Think about the compromised scenerios and accordingly check the logs, memory dumps, Endpoint telemetry.
-- Improving detection rules, refining SIEM correlation logic, and closing visibility gaps. 
-- Also called as “offensive defense” of the SOC.



3. Forensic Analyst-
-- Deeper analysis once an incident occurred.
-- Post-mometurm of alert/incidents.
-- Recover deleted files, analyze registry keys, inspect system memory, and trace timelines from log files. 
-- Work is critical during incident response, litigation, or regulatory investigations.
-- Using tools like FTK, EnCase, or Autopsy, they aim to preserve evidence, identify root causes, and recommend long-term mitigations while maintaining chain-of-custody procedures for legal admissibility.


4. Security Architects/ Security Consultant-
-- Design the blueprint of the organization’s security posture. 
-- They determine how tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS) integrate, how zones are segmented.
-- How policies are enforced across on-prem, cloud, and hybrid environments. 
-- Confim how we select alert/incident risk, select technologies needs. 
-- Security controls aligned with compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, etc.).

Benefits of SOC-
-- 24/7 Monitoring of Threat and responding to them.
-- Incident Handling
-- Early detection of Threats
-- Expertise and Specialization handles by different profiles.

SOC Workflow-

Data Collection --> Data Normalization and Correlation --> Alert Triage --> Incident Investigation --> Incident Investigation --> Recovery --> Recovery, Documentation and Post-incident review.


1. Data Collection-
Gathering of raw data from different sources.

a. Network Devices- 
-- Ex. Firewall, Router, Swtiches, IDS/IPS.
-- Data collected- Traffic flow (Lateral Movement, Privelage Escalation), Blocked ports (Port scanning), Denied connection, Scanning attempts.

c. Endpoint Devices-
-- Ex. EDR, AV, OS
-- Data Collectede- File access, Process creation (Event Viewer, Task manager), Command-line usage (access done on CMD and PowerShell), Registry changes.

d. Servers & Applications-
-- Ex- Database Servers, Web Servers, Email Servers.
-- Data Collected- Authentication logs (Brute-force login/attempts), SQL Queries (SQL injection/ Cross-site scripting), Web Requests, Access Logs.


e. Identity & Access Management-
-- Ex. Active Directory, Okta, LDAP
-- Data Collected- Login, failed login attempts, User provisioning and de-provisioning.

f. Cloud Infrastructure-
-- Ex. AWS CloudTrail, Azure Logs, GCP StackDriver
-- Data Collected- API Calls, Account Changes, Cloud Resources modifications.


g. Security Tools-
-- Ex. SIEM, SOAR, DLP, UEBA
-- Data Collected- Alert, Correlation Output, Risk Scores


h. Threat Intelligence Feeds-
-- Ex. STIX/TAXII, OSINT, Commercial Feeds.
-- Data Collected- Known malicious IPs/Domains, TTPs, IOCs.
