## 📅 Month 1 – Threat Hunting Mindset + KQL Foundations

### Week 1 – Threat Hunting Basics & MITRE ATT&CK

**Day 1 (2–3 hrs)** – Threat Hunting 101 + Why you

* Read 1–2 intro blogs/videos on **Threat Hunting basics** (proactive vs reactive, hypothesis-driven).
* In a notes doc:

  * Write **why you want Threat Hunting** vs SOC & support (5–7 bullet points).
  * Note key terms: “hypothesis”, “data-driven”, “TTP vs IOC”.

**Day 2 (2–3 hrs)** – ATT&CK Overview

* Open **MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix**.
* Focus on tactics:

  * **Execution, Persistence, Lateral Movement**.
* For each tactic, pick **3 techniques** that obviously touch endpoints (e.g. PowerShell, registry run keys, RDP).
* Make a small table in your notes:

  * Technique ID | Name | 1-line description | “What would I see on endpoint?”

**Day 3 (2–3 hrs)** – Microsoft Stack View

* On **Microsoft Learn**, open the SC-200 learning path and skim:

  * “Mitigate threats using Microsoft Defender XDR”
  * Focus on: how endpoints, identity, email, cloud all send data into the security stack.
* Write:

  * Which products you already know (MDE, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud).
  * For each, how Threat Hunter uses them (1–2 bullet points each).

**Day 4 (2–3 hrs)** – MDE Incidents & Alerts

* In your **MDE portal**, open **Incidents**:

  * Pick 1–2 resolved or test incidents.
  * Explore: process tree, alert story, evidence.
* Write in notes:

  * “If I had to hunt around this incident, what would I look for?”

    * e.g., same hash elsewhere, same IP on other devices, same user behaviour.

---

### Week 2 – KQL Basics as a Hunter

**Day 1** – KQL Fundamentals

* In MDE → **Advanced Hunting**, open Query interface.
* Practise:

  * `take 10` from `DeviceProcessEvents`, `DeviceFileEvents`, `DeviceNetworkEvents`.
  * Try queries with:

    * `where Timestamp > ago(1d)`
    * `project DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine`
* Save a few queries in a file: `01_basic_kql.kql`.

**Day 2** – Summarize & Group

* Practise `summarize` and `order by`:

  * Top 20 processes in last 24 hours.
  * Top 20 remote IPs contacted.
  * Count events per device.
* Comment each query: “What question am I answering?”

**Day 3** – Joins & Context

* Learn to **join**:

  * Join `DeviceProcessEvents` (process info) with `DeviceNetworkEvents` (connections) on `DeviceId` & `ProcessId`.
  * Show: process, command line, remote IP, remote port.
* Save as `02_join_process_network.kql`.

**Day 4** – Mini-Hunt: “Top Talkers”

* Create a mini-hunt:

  * Hypothesis: “Malicious tools may talk to suspicious IPs more often than normal apps.”
* Query:

  * Top `FileName` by number of connections
  * Top `RemoteIP` or `RemoteUrl`
* Note any **weird-looking process names** or hosts.

---

### Week 3 – Suspicious PowerShell & Script Abuse

**Day 1** – PowerShell Threat Understanding

* Revisit ATT&CK technique for **PowerShell**.
* In your notes:

  * List suspicious signs: `-enc`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, `DownloadString`, `IEX`, etc.

**Day 2** – Encoded PowerShell Hunt

* Write KQL in Advanced Hunting:

  * `FileName == powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe`
  * `CommandLine` contains `-enc` or `-EncodedCommand`
* Add columns: device, user, parent process, timestamp, full command line.
* Run for last 7–14 days.
* Mark results as:

  * Likely admin / scripts
  * Suspicious / unknown

**Day 3** – Extend PowerShell Hunt

* Expand query: add `CommandLine` with `invoke-webrequest`, `downloadstring`, `iex`, etc.
* Filter out:

  * Known admin machines (if you know them)
  * Service accounts (if any)
* Save final query as `Hunt_EncodedPowershell.kql`.

**Day 4** – PowerShell Hunt Notes

* Create a **hunt summary** (short version):

  * Hypothesis
  * KQL snippet
  * What you saw (patterns)
  * What you consider suspicious
* This is your **Hunt 1 (v0.5)**.

---

### Week 4 – Office → Script Chains & Flow Mastery

**Day 1** – Office-Based Attacks

* Read about **macro-based malware** using documents (Word, Excel, Outlook).
* Map them to ATT&CK techniques:

  * User Execution, Phishing, Command & Scripting Interpreter.

**Day 2** – Office → Shell Hunt (KQL)

* Write a query for `DeviceProcessEvents` where:

  * Parent: `WINWORD.EXE`, `EXCEL.EXE`, `POWERPNT.EXE`, `OUTLOOK.EXE`
  * Child: `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `cscript.exe`, `mshta.exe`
* Run this query for last 7–30 days.

**Day 3** – Grouping & Initial Analysis

* Group results by:

  * Parent–Child pair
  * DeviceName
* Try to identify patterns:

  * Known automation vs unusual one-off behaviour.
* Save query as `Hunt_OfficeToShell.kql`.

**Day 4** – Month 1 Wrap-Up

* Organise:

  * `01_basic_kql.kql`
  * `02_join_process_network.kql`
  * `Hunt_EncodedPowershell.kql`
  * `Hunt_OfficeToShell.kql`
* In a Word/Note doc, write:

  * “Month 1 Summary” – what you can now do:

    * I can write KQL hunts.
    * I understand ATT&CK basics.
    * I have 2 real hunt ideas.

---

## 📅 Month 2 – Deep Use Cases & Real Hunt Reports

### Week 5 – Solid Threat Hunting Method

**Day 1** – Methodology Deep Dive

* Read 1 detailed article on **Threat Hunting Methodology** (hypothesis-driven).
* In notes, define your **4–6 step hunt process** (e.g., Hypothesis → Data → Query → Triage → Findings → Actions).

**Day 2** – Turn PowerShell Hunt into Full Hunt 1

* Take `Hunt_EncodedPowershell.kql`:

  * Refine KQL (clean, comment).
  * Run 7–14 days, capture top results.
* Note 2–3 example “cases” from output.

**Day 3** – Write Full Hunt 1 Report

* In a doc, write sections:

  * Objective
  * Hypothesis
  * Data Sources
  * KQL (with explanation)
  * Findings (example scenarios)
  * Tuning ideas
  * MITRE mapping
  * Response ideas
* This is **Hunt Report 1 (Encoded PowerShell)**.

**Day 4** – Detection Idea from Hunt 1

* Convert this hunt into a **detection idea**:

  * When would you want an alert?
  * What to exclude?
  * Which severity?
* Write a one-page **Detection Spec** for “Suspicious Encoded PowerShell”.

---

### Week 6 – Office Macro Use Case as Hunt 2

**Day 1** – Office Hunt Deepening

* Revisit `Hunt_OfficeToShell.kql`.
* Add: path filtering (temp folder, `Downloads`, user profile scripts), extra columns.

**Day 2** – Run & Analyse Office Hunt

* Run query 7–30 days.
* Identify:

  * Legit automation (if any).
  * 1–2 suspicious-looking process chains (unusual device, odd paths).

**Day 3** – Write Full Hunt 2 Report

* Same structure as Hunt 1:

  * Objective: detect macro-based execution
  * Hypothesis, Data, KQL, Findings, Tuning, MITRE, Response
* Save as **Hunt Report 2 (Office Macro to Shell)**.

**Day 4** – Detection & Tuning from Hunt 2

* Think how you’d detect this **without drowning in alerts**:

  * Only non-automation devices
  * Only temp paths / downloads paths
* Write another **Detection Spec** based on the Office use case.

---

### Week 7 – Lateral Movement / Remote Execution Use Case as Hunt 3

**Day 1** – Lateral Movement Theory

* Read about lateral movement tools:

  * PsExec, WMI, RDP, SMB.
* Note key patterns:

  * Creation of remote services
  * Remote process execution from unexpected hosts.

**Day 2** – KQL for PsExec/WMI

* Write query for **PsExec-like behaviour** (psexec.exe, psexesvc.exe, or command lines with `\\target`).
* Optionally, write a WMI query using `wmic` and “process call create”.

**Day 3** – Run & Analyse

* Run query 14–30 days.
* Label:

  * Expected: from known admin jump host.
  * Suspicious: from random workstation.

**Day 4** – Write Full Hunt 3 Report

* Full doc:

  * Objective: detect possible remote execution & lateral movement
  * Hypothesis, Data, KQL, Findings, Tuning, MITRE, Response
* Save as **Hunt Report 3 (Remote Execution / Lateral Movement)**.

---

### Week 8 – Anomaly Hunting & Tuning Practice

**Day 1** – Anomaly Hunting Basics

* Concept: not just TTPs, but **rare / unusual behaviour**.
* Note examples:

  * Rare processes
  * Rare remote IPs per org
  * Rare parent-child process combos.

**Day 2** – Rare Processes Hunt

* KQL:

  * `summarize count() by FileName`
  * Or `summarize count() by FileName | where count_ < X` to find rarely seen.
* Spot 3–5 weird names / paths, check them deeper.

**Day 3** – Rare IPs or Parent-Child Combos

* Hunt for:

  * Remote IPs contacted by very few devices
  * Parent-child pairs that occur only once or twice.
* Note: which look suspicious vs legit.

**Day 4** – Tuning Exercise

* Take *one* of your hunts (PowerShell / Office / Lateral).
* Intentionally relax filters to make it noisy.
* Then iteratively add filters:

  * Exclude known paths, admin devices, service accounts.
* In notes, create a **Before vs After tuning** table:

  * Condition added → Hit count before/after → FP reduction.

---

## 📅 Month 3 – Complex Hunts, External Labs & Interview Prep

### Week 9 – Multi-Signal Hunt (Endpoint + Risk)

**Day 1** – MDE TVM / Exposure Familiarity

* In MDE, look at **Threat & Vulnerability Management** (if available): exposures, recommendations.
* Note how you could use it in hunting:

  * “Devices with critical vuln + suspicious events.”

**Day 2** – Design Hunt 4: “Vulnerable + Suspicious Behaviour”

* Hypothesis example:

  > “Devices with critical remote code execution vulnerabilities that also connect to rare IPs may be under attack.”
* KQL idea:

  * Join a TVM-related table (if available) with `DeviceNetworkEvents` / `DeviceProcessEvents`.

**Day 3** – Run & Analyse

* Run for 7–30 days.
* Identify 1–2 interesting “high risk + suspicious behaviour” devices.

**Day 4** – Write Full Hunt 4 Report

* Same structure as others.
* This becomes **Hunt Report 4 (Vuln + Behaviour correlation)**.

---

### Week 10 – External Blue-Team / Hunting Labs

**Pick ONE main platform for this week**, e.g.:

* LetsDefend – blue team labs
* TryHackMe blue-team / SOC / threat hunting paths
* CyberDefenders – blue challenges

**Day 1–3** – Hands-on Lab(s)

* Do 1 or 2 relevant **Threat Hunting / Blue team labs**.
* As you go, think:

  * What logs are they using (Sysmon, Windows event logs, SIEM)?
  * How would this look in MDE tables?

**Day 4** – Lab Summary

* For each lab:

  * Scenario summary (1–2 lines)
  * What hunts did you do (searches, filters, reasoning)
  * What *skills* you used (pivoting, correlation, detection thinking)
* Add this as a section in your portfolio: “Hands-on Labs”.

---

### Week 11 – Portfolio & Resume Alignment

**Day 1** – Portfolio Cleanup

* Ensure you have:

  * 4 hunt reports (PowerShell, Office, Lateral Movement, Vuln+Behaviour).
  * KQL scripts for each.
  * At least one tuning example + anomaly hunt notes.

**Day 2** – Map to Job Descriptions

* Open 3–5 Threat Hunter / Detection Engineer job posts.
* For each requirement, map which **hunt / report / skill** in your portfolio proves it.

**Day 3** – Update Resume

* Add bullets like:

  * “Performed proactive threat hunting using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Advanced Hunting and KQL (X+ hunts).”
  * “Developed KQL-based detections for encoded PowerShell, Office macro execution, and remote execution activity.”
  * “Documented hunts with MITRE ATT&CK mapping and response recommendations.”

**Day 4** – LinkedIn & Headline

* Update LinkedIn headline to something like:

  > “Threat Hunter / Detection Engineer | Microsoft Defender for Endpoint & Sentinel | KQL | Incident Investigation & Advanced Hunting”
* Add 1–2 “Featured” items pointing to anonymised hunt summaries (if you’re comfortable).

---

### Week 12 – Interview Prep & Simulation

**Day 1** – Story Answers (Behavioural)
Prepare answers for:

* “Why Threat Hunting vs SOC?”
* “Tell me about a hunt you did” (use your 4 reports).
* “Describe a time you found something unusual and what you did.”

**Day 2** – Technical Whiteboard / Verbal Practice

* Practise out loud:

  * Investigating an MDE alert: step-by-step.
  * Building a detection from a hunt.
  * Explaining KQL queries line by line for one use case.

**Day 3** – Simulated Hunt in 90 Minutes

* Take **any** recent alert / pattern in your tenant or a sample log dataset.
* Time-box:

  * 45–60 mins: query + pivot + analysis
  * 30 mins: write mini report
* Pretend this will be shown to a hiring manager.

**Day 4** – Gap Analysis & Next Steps

* Ask yourself:

  * Which area feels weak? (cloud logs? identity? network?)
* Plan your **next 1–2 months** focus (e.g., Entra ID & Sentinel for identity hunting, or more deep-dive labs).

---

If you want, I can now:

* Turn this 3-month, 4-day/week plan into a **simple Excel tracker** (Week, Day, Task, Resource, Status) you can tick off, or
* Help you draft **“Tell me about a hunt you did”** answers using your 4 main hunts so you sound like a seasoned Threat Hunter in interviews.
