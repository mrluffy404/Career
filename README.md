Nice, this is super clear. Based on everything you wrote and your constraints:

* ✅ Love **alert investigation & defensive security**
* ❌ Don’t want **support** again
* ❌ Don’t want **24/7 / shifts**
* ❌ Not interested in **SOC roles**

Here’s what actually makes sense for you.

---

## 1. Roles that *fit you best* (and are NOT SOC / support)

### 1) **Endpoint Security Engineer / Endpoint Protection Engineer (Microsoft Defender focus)**

**What this role does**

* Owns and engineers **Defender for Endpoint** (and often Intune / M365 / Defender suite) for an organisation.
* Designs:

  * Onboarding/offboarding strategy
  * Endpoint security policies, RBAC
  * AV/EDR exclusions & performance tuning
* Integrates with:

  * **Microsoft Sentinel**
  * **Defender for Cloud**
  * **Intune / SCCM**
  * APIs / automation
* Investigates **high-impact endpoint security incidents**, but as the *owner of the platform*, not L1 ticket support.

**Why this is perfect for you**

You already do almost all of this:

* Onboarding & offboarding, security intelligence, portal issues
* Endpoint Security Policies, RBAC, EDR & AV exclusions
* High CPU / memory troubleshooting due to Defender AV / EDR
* Integration with Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, Intune
* API integration for devices/alerts via Azure app

This role is **defensive**, includes **alert-related investigations**, but is about **owning and improving the platform**, not answering tickets in a queue.

**24/7?**
Most Endpoint Security Engineer roles are **regular office hours** with occasional maintenance—not SOC-style shifts.

> ✅ This should be your **primary target role**.

Search for titles like:

* *Endpoint Security Engineer*
* *Endpoint Protection Engineer*
* *Microsoft Defender Engineer*
* *M365 Endpoint Security Engineer*

---

### 2) **Detection Engineer / Threat Detection Engineer (MDE + Sentinel)**

**What this role does**

* Designs and maintains **detection rules** in SIEM/EDR (e.g. Sentinel + MDE).
* Investigates and analyses alerts to:

  * Confirm true positives
  * Reduce false positives
  * Improve detection logic
* Writes **KQL** rules & Advanced Hunting queries.
* Works closely with SOC but is not L1—more like the brain **behind** the alerts.

**Why this fits you**

You already:

* Investigate alerts in **Defender for Endpoint**
* Use **Advanced Hunting queries**
* Do **Alert Tuning** (this is literally detection engineering work)
* Integrate MDE with **Sentinel** and use **APIs** to pull data

So you’re *already halfway* a Detection Engineer—just not titled that way.

**24/7?**
Many Detection Engineering teams are part of core Cyber Defence / Engineering and are **day shift**. Avoid JDs that say “part of 24/7 SOC” or “rotational shifts”.

Search for titles like:

* *Detection Engineer*
* *Cyber Detection Engineer*
* *Security Detection Content Engineer*
* *Threat Detection Engineer*

This role strongly matches your **alert investigation + defensive** interest.

---

### 3) **Microsoft Security Engineer / M365 Security Engineer (Defender + Intune + Entra)**

**What this role does**

* Focuses on **defensive hardening** of:

  * Microsoft 365
  * Defender suite (Endpoint, Cloud, Identity, Office)
  * Intune and sometimes Purview / DLP
* Investigates and responds to **security issues** but more from a **configuration / architecture** perspective:

  * “Why did this happen?”
  * “Which control failed?”
  * “How do we prevent this next time?”

**Why you’re a fit**

* MDE + Sentinel + Defender for Cloud + Intune experience
* API integration and RBAC knowledge
* Vulnerability management & endpoint security policies

This role still lets you **stay defensive** and do investigations, but from a **broader Microsoft security** angle instead of only endpoints.

**24/7?**
Usually corporate **day jobs**, maybe on-call for critical incidents, but not ticket-based 24/7 operations.

Search for titles like:

* *Microsoft Security Engineer*
* *M365 Security Engineer*
* *Cloud & Endpoint Security Engineer (Microsoft)*

---

### 4) **Threat Hunter (Internal cyber defence / consulting – NOT SOC queue)**

Since you like **alert investigation & defensive work**, Threat Hunter *can* fit, but with a warning.

**What the good version looks like**

* Proactively hunts using MDE + Sentinel + Defender for Cloud + identity logs.
* Does deep investigations: process trees, lateral movement, persistence, etc.
* Writes hunting queries and then works with Detection Engineers to create permanent detections.

**Where it goes wrong (for your preferences)**

* Many Threat Hunter roles sit **inside SOC** or follow **24/7 on-call** patterns.
* To fit your constraints, you’d need Threat Hunter roles in:

  * Internal cyber defence teams, or
  * Consulting / project-based teams

So this can be your **future step** after you get “Detection Engineer / Endpoint Security Engineer” type role.

---

## 2. Roles you should generally **avoid**

Given your preferences:

* ❌ **SOC Analyst (L1/L2/L3)**
  Even if tools are MDE + Sentinel, it's still operations centre, often **24/7**, shift-based, lots of tickets.

* ❌ **Security Support Engineer / Product Support / Technical Support Engineer**
  This will feel exactly like what you’re doing now under a new company name.

* ⚠️ **Generic “Information Security Analyst”**
  In some companies this is more GRC / compliance / ISO / documentation, not hands-on investigation/defence.

---

## 3. Simple career path that fits *you*

If I turn your story into a clean path:

**Now:**
Support Engineer – Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (LTI Mindtree, 3 years)

**Next 1–2 moves (what to target now):**

1. **Endpoint Security Engineer (Defender + Intune + Sentinel)**
2. **Detection Engineer (MDE + Sentinel)**
3. **Microsoft Security Engineer (M365 / Defender suite)**

**Later (3–5 years):**

* Senior Detection Engineer / Threat Hunter (internal defence)
* Security Architect – Endpoint & Microsoft Security

All these are **defensive, investigation-heavy** and **not classic SOC / 24×7**.

---

## 4. If you want, next step I can do for you
If you reply with:

> “Let’s go with Endpoint Security Engineer” **or**
> “Let’s go with Detection Engineer”

I can:

* Rewrite your experience into **resume bullet points** tailored exactly for that role, and
* Give you a small **skills checklist** so you know you’re ready to apply.














Nice, this is going to be fun. I’ll give you:

1. **Two pluggable resume experience sections**

   * Version A → *Endpoint Security Engineer–focused*
   * Version B → *Detection Engineer / Threat Hunter–focused*
2. **3–4 interview Qs + strong sample answers for each role**

You can literally copy–paste and tweak dates/company/location.

# 🎯 Interview Q&A – Endpoint Security Engineer

### Q1. *“Walk me through how you would design and roll out Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in a new environment.”*

**Sample answer:**

> I’d start with **discovery and scoping** – understanding the environment: number of endpoints, OS versions, management tools in use (Intune, ConfigMgr, GPO), and existing AV/EDR solutions.
>
> Next, I’d design the **onboarding strategy**. For example, use Intune for MDM-managed devices, ConfigMgr or GPO for domain-joined servers and clients, and scripts/Local scripts for special cases. I’d also plan **device groups and RBAC**, so different teams have appropriate access and policies can be targeted by role, environment, or sensitivity.
>
> Then I’d define **security baselines and policies** – attack surface reduction rules, tamper protection, antivirus settings, EDR in block mode, and cloud-delivered protection – starting in **audit or passive mode** where needed to avoid disruption.
>
> I’d run a **pilot** with a small set of representative devices, monitor onboarding success, performance impact, and alert behaviour. Based on pilot feedback, I’d adjust exclusions, tune policies, and fix compatibility issues.
>
> Once stable, I’d proceed with a **phased rollout**, communicating with stakeholders, tracking onboarded devices vs. target, and monitoring health from the MDE portal. Finally, I’d integrate with **Sentinel / Defender for Cloud**, set up basic dashboards and reporting, and document runbooks for onboarding, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.

---

### Q2. *“How do you approach high CPU or memory issues caused by Defender AV or EDR?”*

**Sample answer:**

> First, I’d confirm the issue by checking **Task Manager or performance logs** on the affected device and validating whether the Defender processes (like MsMpEng.exe or the EDR sensor) are actually responsible.
>
> Then I’d look at **what Defender is doing** at that time – for example, a full scan, real-time scanning of a large number of files, or intensive monitoring of a specific application. In the MDE portal and local logs, I’d check for **recent scans, configuration changes, or new policies** applied to that device.
>
> If it’s tied to a particular **application or workload**, I’d work with the app team to understand file paths, temp locations, and working directories. Based on that, I’d create **targeted AV/EDR exclusions** for specific folders, processes, or file types, following Microsoft’s best practices and avoiding overly broad exclusions that weaken security.
>
> I’d also ensure features are **configured optimally** – for instance, using cloud-delivered protection, scheduling scans at low-usage times, and avoiding overlapping third-party scans.
>
> Finally, I’d monitor the device after changes, compare performance before/after, and roll out similar, validated exclusions to other affected devices in a controlled way. If patterns suggest a product-side issue, I’d escalate with logs and traces to the vendor or internal engineering.

---

### Q3. *“How do you design a good AV/EDR exclusion strategy without compromising security?”*

**Sample answer:**

> I follow a **least-privilege mindset for exclusions**. I never start by adding broad exclusions like `C:\` or `Program Files`. Instead, I first **investigate the root cause**: which specific paths, processes, or file types are causing false positives or performance problems.
>
> I involve the **application owners** to understand how the app works – its executable path, temp folders, and data directories. Then I create **narrow exclusions**: for example, excluding only the required process or a specific folder used by the app, and only for the necessary component (AV, EDR, or both).
>
> Whenever possible, I rely on **vendor-recommended exclusions** and also review them from a security perspective. After implementing new exclusions, I **monitor the device** and related alerts to ensure stability and no obvious security blind spots.
>
> I also document all exclusions with the **reason, owner, and date**, so we can periodically review and remove those that are no longer needed. This keeps the exclusion list lean and reduces long-term risk.

---

### Q4. *“Explain how you integrated Defender for Endpoint with Intune / Sentinel / Defender for Cloud in your current role.”*

**Sample answer:**

> With **Intune**, I’ve used it to deploy the MDE onboarding package and manage security settings. We configure **endpoint security policies** and security baselines in Intune, which push Defender AV, EDR, and firewall configurations to enrolled devices. Intune also lets us see compliance status and tie it into Conditional Access if needed.
>
> With **Microsoft Sentinel**, we’ve integrated MDE so that **alerts and device events** flow into Sentinel as a data connector. This allows SOC or security teams to correlate MDE alerts with other signals like identity, network, or M365 logs. I help verify that alerts are coming in correctly, and I support building KQL queries in Sentinel based on MDE data.
>
> With **Defender for Cloud**, integration helps surface workload protection and vulnerability information for servers and cloud resources. MDE serves as the **endpoint sensor**, so I make sure onboarded servers are properly reporting into both MDE and Defender for Cloud, giving a unified view of vulnerabilities and recommendations.
>
> Across all these, I also work with **APIs** in some cases to pull device and alert metadata into internal tools, for reporting and automation.

---

# 🎯 Interview Q&A – Detection Engineer / Threat Hunter

### Q1. *“How do you approach investigating an alert from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?”*

**Sample answer:**

> I start by looking at the **alert details in MDE**: alert title, category, severity, and the affected device and user. I quickly check whether it matches a known pattern or if it’s something unusual.
>
> Then I drill into the **alert story / incident graph**: process tree, command lines, file hashes, network connections, and any related alerts. I want to see the **timeline** – what happened before and after the alert.
>
> Next, I use **Advanced Hunting (KQL)** to pivot: for example, search for the same hash, process name, or command line across other devices; look for the same IP/domain; and check whether the user or device has other suspicious activity.
>
> Based on what I see, I classify it as **true positive, benign/expected, or false positive**. If it’s a true positive, I identify the recommended **containment and remediation steps** (isolate device, stop process, remove file, block indicator, patch or reconfigure).
>
> Regardless of outcome, I look for ways to **improve detection** – for example, if it’s noisy but expected behaviour, I might propose tuning based on path, process, or device group. If it’s a new pattern, I consider how we could **write a hunting query or detection rule** to catch similar activity earlier or with more context.

---

### Q2. *“How do you use Advanced Hunting / KQL for detection and threat hunting?”*

**Sample answer:**

> I use **Advanced Hunting** both reactively and proactively.
>
> Reactively, when there’s an alert, I write KQL queries to **pivot around the alert entity** – such as a file hash, process name, IP, or user – to see where else it appears, what executed it, and what followed. For example, I’ll query `DeviceProcessEvents` joined with `DeviceNetworkEvents` to trace process chains and external connections.
>
> Proactively, I build **hunting queries** based on common attacker techniques. For example:
>
> * Suspicious PowerShell usage with encoded commands or downloading from the internet
> * Unusual use of `cmd.exe` or scripting engines spawning from Office apps
> * New local admin creation outside standard tools
>
> I use KQL functions like `summarize`, `join`, and filtering with `has`, `contains`, `startswith`, and watch for anomalies such as rare processes or unusual parent-child relationships.
>
> When a hunting query proves useful, I work on **refining it into a repeatable detection**, considering how to reduce noise and what entities and thresholds make sense. That way, hunting results can evolve into **formal detection content**.

---

### Q3. *“How do you tune a noisy detection so it still catches real attacks but generates fewer false positives?”*

**Sample answer:**

> I start by analysing a **sample set of alerts** from that detection – both true positives and false positives. I look for **patterns** in the false positives: specific devices, paths, processes, command-line arguments, or service accounts that generate legitimate activity.
>
> Then I refine the detection logic by:
>
> * Adding **allow conditions** or exclusions for known-good paths, processes, or device groups.
> * Tightening conditions, for example, requiring multiple indicators (suspicious parent + child process + network connection), rather than just one.
> * Adjusting **thresholds or frequency** (e.g., only alert if an action happens N times in M minutes or across multiple devices).
>
> I always validate the updated rule with **historical data** to ensure it still catches true positives and doesn’t miss important scenarios. If needed, I keep some events in **audit or low-severity mode** to monitor impact before making it fully blocking or high-severity.
>
> Finally, I document the tuning decision and keep an eye on the detection’s performance over time, so we can re-tune if environment or attacker behaviour changes.

---

### Q4. *“Describe a threat hunting hypothesis you’ve used or would use with MDE + Sentinel.”*

**Sample answer:**

> A simple but effective example is:
>
> **Hypothesis:** “If an attacker is trying to move laterally using remote execution tools like PsExec or WMI, we should see unusual service creations or remote process execution patterns from admin workstations or servers.”
>
> To test this, I’d use **MDE Advanced Hunting** over `DeviceProcessEvents` and `DeviceEvents` to look for:
>
> * Processes like `psexec.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `winrm`, or `sc.exe` creating services remotely
> * New services created with suspicious binary paths or from non-standard admin devices
>
> I might then **join with Sentinel data** (e.g., sign-in logs) to see if the same account had unusual login locations or failed logons around that time.
>
> If the hunt finds interesting hits, I investigate them further: check the devices, user accounts, and whether there was any associated malware or alerts. If it’s truly malicious or risky, I turn the successful hunting pattern into a **detection rule** and possibly recommend hardening measures (restricting remote tools, tightening admin access).

## 🎤 Role-Specific Interview Questions

Below are **HR/Behavioral + Technical** questions for each role.
You can use the previous message’s Q&A as ready-made sample answers for some technical ones.

---

### 🛡️ A. Endpoint Security Engineer – HR / Behavioral Questions

1. **Why do you want to move from a support engineer role into an Endpoint Security Engineer position?**

## 🔥 3 Full Hunt Reports / Detection Writeups

You can reuse these as **templates + interview stories**.
They’re written in a professional format you’d use in a real team.

---

### 🧵 Hunt 1 – Suspicious Encoded PowerShell Execution

**Use Case Name:**
Suspicious Encoded PowerShell Usage on Endpoints

**Objective:**
Identify potentially malicious use of PowerShell where attackers use **encoded commands** or download/execution behaviours that may bypass simple string-based detections.

---

#### 1. Hypothesis

> “If an attacker is using PowerShell for malicious activity (initial access, execution, or payload delivery), we will observe PowerShell processes with encoded commands or download/execution functions that are uncommon for normal users.”

---

#### 2. Data Sources

* **MDE Advanced Hunting tables:**

  * `DeviceProcessEvents`
  * (Optional) `DeviceNetworkEvents` for outbound connections

---

#### 3. Detection / Hunting Logic (KQL Example)

```kusto
// Suspicious Encoded PowerShell Activity
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe")
| extend CommandLineLower = tolower(CommandLine)
| where CommandLineLower has "-enc" 
      or CommandLineLower has "-encodedcommand"
      or CommandLineLower has "invoke-webrequest"
      or CommandLineLower has "invoke-expression"
      or CommandLineLower has "downloadstring"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName,
          FileName, ProcessCommandLine = CommandLine,
          InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc
```

**Optional enrichment with network:**

```kusto
// Join PowerShell with network connections from same process
let suspicious_ps = 
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName in~ ("powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe")
| extend CommandLineLower = tolower(CommandLine)
| where CommandLineLower has "-enc" 
      or CommandLineLower has "invoke-webrequest"
      or CommandLineLower has "downloadstring"
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, ProcessId, Timestamp,
          InitiatingProcessAccountName,
          ProcessCommandLine = CommandLine;
suspicious_ps
| join kind=leftouter (
    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where Timestamp > ago(7d)
    | project DeviceId, RemoteUrl, RemoteIP, RemotePort,
              ProcessId, NetTimestamp = Timestamp
) on DeviceId, ProcessId
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName,
          ProcessCommandLine, RemoteUrl, RemoteIP, RemotePort, NetTimestamp
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

#### 4. Execution Steps

1. Run initial query for last **7 days** in Advanced Hunting.
2. Review **top hits**:

   * Look for unusual `InitiatingProcessAccountName` (non-admin, standard users).
   * Look at `InitiatingProcessFileName` – who spawned PowerShell? (Office app? Browser? Script?).
3. For suspicious entries, use the **network-join query** to see whether:

   * PowerShell connected to rare / external domains or IPs.
4. Deep dive suspicious cases:

   * Check device timeline / incident graph.
   * Look for file writes, subsequent process launches, persistence changes.

---

#### 5. Findings (Example)

* Most encoded PowerShell use came from:

  * Admin tools / IT scripts (expected; to be documented as known-good).
* A small number of hits from:

  * A user’s device where `WINWORD.EXE` spawned `powershell.exe` with `-EncodedCommand` and outbound HTTP to a rare domain → flagged as **highly suspicious**.

---

#### 6. Tuning Considerations

* Add **allow conditions** for:

  * Known admin script paths or management servers.
* Restrict detection to:

  * Non-admin users, or devices not in “IT Admin” group.
* Add **frequency threshold**:

  * E.g. alert only if behaviour occurs more than N times in M minutes.

---

#### 7. Detection Rule Idea

* Create a **detection rule** in Sentinel or M365 Defender with:

  * Condition: `powershell.exe` with encoded command / download functions
  * AND parent process not in allow-list (e.g., not known EDR tool)
  * AND user not in “admin service account” allow-list.

---

#### 8. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

* **Tactic:** Execution
* **Technique:** T1059.001 – PowerShell

---

#### 9. Response Guidance

For high-confidence hits:

* **Contain:** Isolate device if malicious activity confirmed.
* **Investigate:**

  * Check for additional payloads, persistence, credential theft.
  * Review browser, email, or document source that triggered the behaviour.
* **Remediate:**

  * Remove malicious files/scripts.
  * Block associated IPs/domains/hashes with indicator rules.
* **Improve:**

  * Educate users if social engineering was involved.
  * Hardening: restrict PowerShell for standard users where possible.

---

### 🧵 Hunt 2 – Office Macro → Script/Command Execution Chain

**Use Case Name:**
Office Application Spawning Scripting Engines or Shell

**Objective:**
Detect potential **macro-based or document-based malware** where Office apps (Word, Excel, Outlook) spawn scripting engines (`wscript`, `cscript`) or shells (`cmd`, `powershell`).

---

#### 1. Hypothesis

> “If a malicious document or macro is used to execute payloads, we will see Office processes spawning scripting engines or shell processes that are unusual in normal business workflows.”

---

#### 2. Data Sources

* `DeviceProcessEvents` (main)
* (Optional) `DeviceFileEvents` for dropped payloads

---

#### 3. Detection / Hunting Logic (KQL Example)

```kusto
// Office Macro-Like Process Chains
let OfficeParents = dynamic(["winword.exe", "excel.exe", "powerpnt.exe", "outlook.exe"]);
let SuspiciousChildren = dynamic(["powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe", "cmd.exe", "wscript.exe", "cscript.exe", "mshta.exe"]);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where tolower(InitiatingProcessFileName) in~ OfficeParents
| where tolower(FileName) in~ SuspiciousChildren
| project Timestamp, DeviceName,
          ParentProcess = InitiatingProcessFileName,
          ParentCommandLine = InitiatingProcessCommandLine,
          ChildProcess = FileName,
          ChildCommandLine = CommandLine,
          InitiatingProcessAccountName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

#### 4. Execution Steps

1. Run for last 7–30 days to build baseline.
2. Group by:

   * `ParentProcess` + `ChildProcess` + maybe `DeviceName`.
3. Identify:

   * Repeated patterns from **specific automation systems** (might be allowed).
   * Rare combinations (e.g., `OUTLOOK.EXE → powershell.exe` on user laptop).
4. For suspicious hits:

   * Open MDE incident view (if any) or full timeline.
   * Check `DeviceFileEvents` for newly created executables/scripts around same time.

---

#### 5. Findings (Example)

* Some devices show:

  * `EXCEL.EXE → cmd.exe` as part of legitimate internal automation by Finance (requires business confirmation, maybe allow-list).
* One rare case:

  * `OUTLOOK.EXE → wscript.exe` with script in temp folder and outbound traffic to random domain → flagged as suspicious.

---

#### 6. Tuning Considerations

* Allow-list known-good:

  * Internal automation hosts
  * Known script paths & signed scripts.
* Add extra conditions for high-risk:

  * Temp directories (`C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp`), downloads folder.
  * Command lines containing URLs, encoded commands, or suspicious flags.

---

#### 7. Detection Rule Idea

* Alert when:

  * `OUTLOOK.EXE` or `WINWORD.EXE` spawns `powershell.exe`/`wscript.exe`
  * AND command line contains URL / encoded or obfuscated commands
  * AND device not in automation/IT list.

---

#### 8. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

* **Tactic:** Execution, Initial Access
* **Techniques:**

  * T1204 – User Execution
  * T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter
  * T1566.001 – Phishing (email with attachment) if mail-based

---

#### 9. Response Guidance

* **Check email/document source** – who sent it, phishing pattern.
* **Isolate** device if further suspicious behaviour found.
* **Collect** malicious doc/script for sandboxing and intel.
* **Block** associated hashes, URLs, and sender where needed.
* **Awareness** – targeted user training if social engineering involved.

---

### 🧵 Hunt 3 – Remote Execution / PsExec/WMI-like Lateral Movement

**Use Case Name:**
Potential Lateral Movement via Remote Execution Tools

**Objective:**
Identify suspicious **remote execution / lateral movement** using PsExec-like behaviour or WMI, often used after initial compromise.

---

#### 1. Hypothesis

> “If an attacker is laterally moving within the network, we will see unusual remote execution behaviours such as service creation or remote process execution originating from admin systems or compromised hosts.”

---

#### 2. Data Sources

* `DeviceProcessEvents`
* `DeviceEvents` (service creation, remote execution events)
* `DeviceNetworkEvents` (optional, for RDP/admin shares)

*(Exact table names can vary slightly; use what’s available in your tenant.)*

---

#### 3. Detection / Hunting Logic (KQL Example)

**PsExec / Service-Style Behaviour**

```kusto
// Potential PsExec-Like Activity via Services
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(14d)
| where tolower(FileName) in~ ("psexec.exe", "psexesvc.exe")
      or ProcessCommandLine has @"\\"
      or ProcessCommandLine has "psexec"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName,
          FileName, ProcessCommandLine,
          InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine,
          InitiatingProcessAccountName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

**WMI-based Remote Execution (example heuristic)**

```kusto
// WMI Command-Line Usage
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(14d)
| where tolower(FileName) in~ ("wmic.exe", "powershell.exe")
| where CommandLine has_any ("wmic", "win32_process", "process call create")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName,
          FileName, CommandLine,
          InitiatingProcessAccountName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

#### 4. Execution Steps

1. Run queries for last 14–30 days.
2. For each hit:

   * Look at originating `DeviceName` – is it known admin jump box or random workstation?
   * Check `InitiatingProcessAccountName` – domain admin? service account? end user?
3. Correlate with:

   * `DeviceNetworkEvents` for RDP or admin share usage.
   * Any associated alerts (credential theft, suspicious logon, etc.).
4. For cases on **unexpected devices/accounts**:

   * Deep-dive incident graphs and timelines.
   * Look for follow-up execution, new services, or new local admin accounts.

---

#### 5. Findings (Example)

* Expected:

  * Known IT admin jump server running PsExec to maintain legacy servers.
* Suspicious:

  * A standard user workstation running `wmic` remote process commands targeting multiple servers where user should not have admin rights.

---

#### 6. Tuning Considerations

* Create **allow-list**:

  * Approved admin tools, specific management servers, known service accounts.
* Raise severity when:

  * Execution originates from **non-admin** devices/accounts.
  * Targets high-value assets (DCs, DB servers).

---

#### 7. Detection Rule Idea

* Detection:

  * Trigger when remote execution patterns (PsExec/WMI style) originate from devices **outside** admin VLAN/jump hosts or by non-admin accounts.
* Fields to use:

  * `DeviceName`, `InitiatingProcessAccountName`, `ProcessCommandLine`, remote target info.

---

#### 8. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

* **Tactic:** Lateral Movement
* **Techniques:**

  * T1021 – Remote Services
  * T1569 – System Services (for service-based execution)
  * T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation (if using WMI)

---

#### 9. Response Guidance

* **Verify legitimacy** with IT admin teams – was this authorised maintenance?
* If not:

  * **Isolate** suspected source device.
  * Check for credential theft on that device.
  * Investigate all remote targets for follow-up actions (new services, malware).
* **Hardening:**

  * Restrict remote admin tools to jump hosts.
  * Reduce local admin privileges for users.

---
